%The first problem.
\begin{problem}
Let $p$ and $q$ be two statements.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a truth table for $p \land q$ and $q \land p$.  (In other words, fill out the truth table below.  To help you out at first with LaTex, I already typed the table.)
\item What do you notice??
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

%The solution environment in which you type your first try.
\begin{solution}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
$p$ & $q$ & $p \land q$ & $q \land p$  \\
\hline
 1 & 1 & & \\
 1 & 0 & & \\
 0 & 1 & & \\
 0 & 0 & &
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
I notice that ...

\end{solution}

For the second problem, you are on your own.  Based on the previous problem, build the table in LaTex.  There should be $7$ columns.
%The second problem.
\begin{problem}
Let $p$ and $q$ be statements.  Construct the truth table for the compound statement
$$(p \lor q) \lor ((\neg p) \land q) \to q $$
\end{problem}

%The solution environment in which you type your first try.
\begin{solution}
The truth table for $(p \lor q) \lor ((\neg p) \land q) \to q$ is ... 

\end{solution}

If you have a problem with LaTex, you can always come to my office hours and when you do so, bring your laptop with you.
